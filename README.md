This library should be usefull for parsing JSON and working with it. Main features are: support of <a href="https://github.com/json5/json5">JSON5</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/vi/json2">JSON2</a>. In the future, support for other versions of JSON is also possible. This project was made to combine 
abilities of different JSON versions in one library.
